Because some things are designed in a special away that really makes it too annoying to just download a single file. This project hopefully removes all that work.

This is just for the sake to "One-Tap To Download" the files.

Browsing on it is also straightforward, but you [can](https://github.com/lnxsnw/cdn/blob/553b24b0f533907cc9ae6a596c0ca9be1baff863/backend.js#L183)'t preview files by default because of site limitations. The loading may be slow, idk why.
