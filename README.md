Because some things are designed in a special away that really makes it too annoying to just download a single file. This project hopefully removes all that work.

This is just for the sake to "One-Tap To Download" the files.

Browsing on it is also straightforward, but you [can](https://github.com/lnxsnw/cdn/blob/e00a3bf61e552bcbb6c98f8eda6b0758c5e3ad74/backend.js#L183)'t preview files by default because of site limitations. The loading may be slow, idk why.
